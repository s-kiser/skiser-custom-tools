# TOOLBELTS

Toolbox -> toolbelts -> toolbags -> tools... and a buckle (auot-run-programs)

the toolbox is the program that you install and run when you donwload toolbelts. Toolbox will allow you to create a local repository of toolbelts that you download from xxx. Toolbelts consist of collections of toolbags, which are collections of tools.

an example of two toolbelts in a toolbox would be: gamedev-toolbelt, webdev-toolbelt. maybe even more specific since different companies will value different toolsets.
lets say ubisoft and activision have their own tools for a toolbelt, but we know they are for gamedev, you can label them as such: activision-gamedev, and ubisoft-developer; just for an example.

lets go with a custom toolbelt, lets say we want something called andys-gamedev-belt, and lets structure everything in a list:

    andys-gamedev (toolbelt)
        Autoload-peripherals (buckle)
        3d (toolbag)
            3dcoat
            blender
            godot
        animation (toolbag)
            mixamo-studio
            boats-animator
            pencil-2d
            synfig-studios
            opentoonz
        audio (toolbag)
            audacity
            mixafy
            freesoundsgenerator
