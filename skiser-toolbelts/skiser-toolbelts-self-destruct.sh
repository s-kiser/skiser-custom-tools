# each belt should have instructions as to how to handle a slef-destruct.
# for instance, one of my belts create new directories in the home directory, and installs cettain apt packages.
# the self destruct file for that belt should have uninstall and rm -rf instructions
# self destruct files should be .detonate
# belts should also have a similar file called .buckle
